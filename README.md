🎯 About the Project
Welcome to the Black Ops 6 MultiCheat—an experimental, fully batch-scripted project aimed at showcasing how command-line scripting can simulate cheat functionalities in a game (Call of Duty: Black Ops 6).

This project is a fun and creative exploration of:
Windows Batch scripting techniques
ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) effects
Aimbot logic
Windows automation and command-line operations
This script is compatible with Windows 10 & Windows 11 and serves as a proof-of-concept for how batch scripts can be pushed to their limits!

🎮 Features
✅ Aimbot Simulation – Mimics target-locking mechanisms
✅ ESP (Wallhack) – Highlights "targets" with simulated overlays
✅ Radar Hack – Displays a mini-radar using batch animations
✅ Unlock All – Unlocks all skins & camos
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple Command-Line UI
✅ Auto-Updater – Updates the script with a single click
✅ Stealth Mode – Simulated obfuscation techniques for fun

💡 Note: Since this is entirely written in Batch, there are some glitches/errors.

🛠 Installation & Usage

🚀 How It Works
Since Batch cannot directly interact with game memory, this project uses creative workarounds like:

ASCII Animations for ESP and Radar effects
⚡ Upcoming Features
☑ Enhanced menu UI with dynamic ASCII art
☑ More realistic ESP visualization
☑ HWID spoofer for fun
☑ Additional sound effects for better immersion

🏆 Why Batch?
You might wonder—why Batch? It’s outdated, right?
Yes, but this project pushes Batch to its limits and showcases how you can create fun and unexpected effects using just Windows' built-in scripting language!

This is a learning experiment that explores:

Command-line scripting logic
Windows automation tricks
🔒 Legal Notice
Any misuse of similar concepts in actual cheating scenarios is strongly discouraged.
